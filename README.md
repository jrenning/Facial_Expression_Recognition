# Facial_Expression_Recognition

This project creates a CNN model that identifies various facial expressions on either static or moving images. The model can be loaded with a preset video or it can be set to detect facial expressiosn from an attached webcam. The project comes from following a guided project [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/facial-expression-recognition-keras), but some sections are changed by me to make it more my own.

*Testing and training data for the model are not included*
